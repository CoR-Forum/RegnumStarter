# RegnumStarter

This tool requires the [RegnumStarter-API](https://github.com/RegnumStarter/RegnumStarter-API).

## Overview

RegnumStarter is an application designed to run on Windows, although development is also possible on macOS.

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build the application on both operating systems.

## Branches

* **main** - Latest stable version
* **dev** - Current development branch

## Build Instructions

### Build on macOS

1. **Build the application:**
    ```sh
    i686-w64-mingw32-windres resource.rc resource.o && \
    i686-w64-mingw32-g++ -Ilibs/imgui -o bin/RegnumStarter.exe RegnumStarter.cpp libs/imgui/imgui.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_draw.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_widgets.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_tables.cpp resource.o -lurlmon -lwininet -ld3d9 -ldwmapi -static -mwindows && wine bin/RegnumStarter.exe
    ```

    The first part of the command compiles the resource file, which is then included in the program file.

    **Note:** You can also add `&& wine RegnumStarter.exe` at the end while debugging.

### Build on Windows

1. **Install MSYS2:**
    - Download and install from [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

2. **Open MSYS2 MINGW64 Shell.**

3. **Update all packages:**
    ```sh
    pacman -Syu
    ```
    After the terminal restarts, run the command again:
    ```sh
    pacman -Syu
    ```

4. **Install MinGW-w64 GCC toolchain:**
    ```sh
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    ```

5. **Build the application:**
    1. Navigate to `C:\`:
        ```sh
        cd /c
        ```
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Create a `bin` folder, likely with
        ```sh
        mkdir tmp/
        ```
    4. Run the build command:
        ```sh
        windres resource.rc resource.o && g++ -o bin/RegnumStarter.exe RegnumStarter.cpp libs/imgui/imgui.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_draw.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_widgets.cpp libs/imgui/imgui_tables.cpp resource.o -lurlmon -lwininet -ld3d9 -ldwmapi -static -mwindows && ./bin/RegnumStarter.exe
        ```

## Update Process

1. Bump the Version in ``version.txt``. Note that right now, after 1.0.9, we are forced to use 1.1.0 because 1.0.10 would be counted lower than 1.0.9. Ask @Joshua2504 if anything is unclear, as this might break everything.

2. Write a Changelog in ``changelog.md``
3. Merge to **main** branch.

The build process will start. You can follow up by clicking *Actions* in the top menu. If the build process is successfull, the new update has been released and this has happened:

- Updated changelog on website.
- Created new release on Github.
- Uploaded new version to patch server.

If the build process fails, check the Actions logs, but it's likely because:

- The version number has not been increased (release already exists)
- Changelog is missing.

## Debugging

To enable debugging, you need to add ``"debug": true`` to your login-settings.json, for example:

```
{
    "saveUsername": true,
    "showPassword": false,
    "showUsername": false,
    "username": "joshua2504"
    "debug": true
}
```
